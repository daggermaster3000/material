# Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)

- write 2-3 sentences about what the method does and what it is used for

ChIP-seq uses a formaldehyde treatement to fixate DNA interacting proteins. The DNA with the bound proteins is then fragmented. Immunoprecipitation is used in order to isolate DNA bound to a protein of interest. The isolated DNA is amplified, fragmented and sequenced.


- make the link (technology -> application -> statistics)

| Technology    | Application   | Statistics |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
|  ChIP-seq | Analysis of DNA binding sites (regulatory elements), chromatin interaction identification | Negative binomial, dynamic Poisson distribution |


- create a markdown file (name it with the selected technology) with the description as backup, include the GitHub usernames of all in the group (if you've joined the group, i should be able to see this) fork the [material](https://github.com/sta426hs2022/material) repo add your markdown file to the `week02-26sep2022` directory of the fork send a pull request to the main branch repo of the `material` repo
